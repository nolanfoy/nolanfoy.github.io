This project was one from my web development class where we were assigned to make our own personal website.
It is a relatively simple site with a few different website sections.
It was really nice to have an assignment be making yourself a website because you always think to do it, but it is hard to get started, especially when
you haven't learned about all of the things that we learn in web development.  
There is a homepage where there is a short about me section where I briefly talk about myself. 
There is also a project page where I list some of the projects that I have done over the course of my college career including an embedded version of 
my creative coding project that I listed in my personal README.
The next page is my resume page, where my resume is created in a website format. It includes my experience, my education, and my skills.
Finally, the last page is just called "fun stuff", where I talk a little more about me and what I like to do.
There is a section called what I like to do, a section called "What About My Future", and a section about my favorite foods.

I really enjoyed this project because of the design aspects, and because we finally got to learn how to get a website up, how to link pages to each other
and many other things regarding website development.
